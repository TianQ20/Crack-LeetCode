* [7. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

* [8. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

* [9. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

* [10. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/) Optimize from O(N) to O(log N) time complexity.

* [11. Flatten a multilevel doubly linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/)

* [12. Output data from a stream in order](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/314733/Bloomberg-or-Output-data-from-a-stream-in-order)

```java
Input: (1, "abcd"), (2, "efgh"), (4, "mnop"), (5, "qrst"), (3, "ijkl")

Write a program to output the data from the stream in realtime in order, so 1,2,3,4,5..
You cannot queue up the incoming data from the stream.
So for example if the first incoming bit of data is (1, "abcd"), and the second is (4, "mnop"), you cannot output (4, "mnop") until you get 2, 3.
```

* [13. Find the minimum steps to generate a number given only two operations (BFS)](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/406663/Bloomberg-or-Phone-Screen-or-Min-Steps-to-Generate-Number)
