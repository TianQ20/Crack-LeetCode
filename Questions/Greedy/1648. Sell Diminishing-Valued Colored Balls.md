# [1648. Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/sell-diminishing-valued-colored-balls/)

To get the maximum total value, we greedily take biggest values. We need to sort the inventory array in the descending order, then choose current as `inventory[0]`, once we take the biggest value, then the biggest value would decrease by 1, we also need to calculate the number of the same value. We use a math formula to calculate the values of an increasing sequence, `(x + 1) + ... + (n - 1) + n = (x + 1+ n) / 2 * (n - x)`, but if the orders are smaller than a fully loop, we need to greedily take values as much as possible.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] A, int orders) {
        int n = A.length, mod = (int)1e9 + 7;
        Arrays.sort(A);
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            int tmp = A[i];
            A[i] = A[n - 1 - i];
            A[n - 1 - i] = tmp;
        }

        int cur = A[0];
        long ans = 0;
        int c = 0; // same color balls number
        while (orders > 0) {
            while (c < n && A[c] == cur) {
                ++c;
            }
            int next = c == n ? 0 : A[c];
            int count = (int)Math.min((long)orders, (c * (cur - next)));
            int t = cur - next;
            int r = 0;
            if (orders < c * (cur - next)) { // if not enough orders, take care of the last loop
                t = orders / c;
                r = orders % c;
            }
            long next_p = cur - t;
            ans = (ans + (cur + next_p + 1) * t / 2 * c + next_p * r) % mod; // math formula
            orders -= count;
            cur = next;
        }
        return (int)ans;
    }
}
```
