# [407. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/)

## Intuition

Loop the nodes from boundary to inside. The capacity of each node is decided by the shortest boundary.

We each time choose the shortest boundary to move inward. Use a min-heap to store the boundaries.

### Python3

```Python3
import heapq
class Solution:
    def trapRainWater(self, heightMap: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        h, w = len(heightMap), len(heightMap[0])
        if w < 3 or h < 3: return 0
        
        # BFS starts from boundary
        dirs = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        heap = []
        for i in range(len(heightMap)):
            for j in range(len(heightMap[0])):
                if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (heightMap[i][j], i, j))
                    heightMap[i][j] = -1 # mark as visited
        res = 0
        hmax = 0
        while heap:
            hei, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if hei > hmax: hmax = hei
            else: res += hmax - hei
            
            for x_inc, y_inc in dirs:
                nei_x, nei_y = x + x_inc, y + y_inc
                if 0 <= nei_x < h and 0 <= nei_y < w and heightMap[nei_x][nei_y] >= 0:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (heightMap[nei_x][nei_y], nei_x, nei_y))
                    heightMap[nei_x][nei_y] = -1
        return res
```
