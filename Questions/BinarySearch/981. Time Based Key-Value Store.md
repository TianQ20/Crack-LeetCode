# [981. Time Based Key-Value Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/)

## Intuition

**Binary Search**

Using `dict` to store the key and value pair of `key` and `timestamp`. 

According to the question, the timestamp is incresing when operating, so the array of timestamp of each key is a `sorted` array in `dict`.

Hence, we can using binarysearch to find the first timestamp that smaller or equal to the target timestamp.


**Time:** `O(NlogN)`
**Space:** `O(N)`

```python
class TimeMap:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.dict = collections.defaultdict(list)

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        self.dict[key].append([value, timestamp])

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        if key not in self.dict:
            return ""
        arr = self.dict[key]

        ln = len(arr)
        l,r = 0, ln-1

        while l < r:
            mid = l + ( r - l + 1)//2
            if arr[mid][1] <= timestamp:
                l = mid
            else:
                r = mid - 1
        return arr[r][0] if arr[r][1] <= timestamp else  ""

```
